# Voting dApp System

## Overview
This project aims to explore the application of Web 3.0 technologies in creating a decentralized voting system. By leveraging blockchain technology, we seek to enhance the security, transparency, and accessibility of voting processes. This system is designed to be tamper-proof, ensuring the integrity of each vote. Our approach utilizes a front-end built with Next.js, communicating with a Laravel-based back-end via REST API, alongside blockchain integration for vote handling.
