Cryptocurrencies are like arcade tokens, but for the digital world. They're made by solving complex puzzles‚Äînot with pen and paper, but with powerful computers!

## Why is Decentralization Cool?

Decentralization means no single party has control, kind of like having a group project but no one is the boss.
